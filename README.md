# rust_parse_describe
rust_parse_describe is a tool intended for use by Rust IDEs/editors. 

It performs a single operation, a "parse-analysis" of a Rust source file, and returns useful information such as:
 * Parse errors (if any). This can be used to provide on-the-fly parse errors reporting in the editor.
 * The structural elements of the source file (that is, the top-level definitions). This can be used to provide an editor outline, or the ranges for editor folding.
